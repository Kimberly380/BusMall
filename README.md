# BusMall
CodeFellowsProjectWeek3

The purpose of this project is to help BusMall (a fictitious retailer) decide what products to include in their catalog.  The catalogs will be distributed in buses, much like SkyMall is currently in airplanes.

##TEST
To perform this market research, this app will display three photos of possible products.  I've put food items just for fun.  The subject will then select which of the three they prefer.

##USER STORIES
*Client would like photos to be displayed in an attractive way that represents their organization.
*User should easily understand the task of choosing one of three images, in a clearly marked, easy to use interface.
*User should be allowed to view results of their selections at end of survey.
*Client would like data to be collected and analysis provided so they can make decisions on what products to buy.
